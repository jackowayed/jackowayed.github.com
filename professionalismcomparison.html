title: Which is Better?

<p> Do you care more about job application documents (cover letter, resume, etc.) being a little laid back and fun, or completely serious and professional?</p>

<p> This is an excerpt of the letter written in both manners: </p>

<div style="width: 45%; float: left;">
  <h1>A</h1>
  <p>Now for the downside: I'm not quite looking for the position you posted in that job posting. I'm much more inexperienced (I believe the business term is "cheap to hire.") than you want for that position, and I'm a junior in high school looking for a summer job working remotely. (Relocating is unrealistic given my age.) I would be able to perform the Rails and Java work that you want done, but I would do so from my house, and after summer, I would have to drastically reduce my hours. </p>
  
  <p>I hope that my lack of job experience and inability to work permanently do not prevent you from considering me. I have solid knowledge of how to program (see my resume for AP tests and projects that prove it.). I could be a jolt of energy helping you get a few new, cool features out the door. I also have a business-oriented facet of my mind, so I could help think of premium features that people would actually pay for or possibly even float other business models. </p>
</div>

<div style="margin: auto; width: 45%: padding: 1em; left: 50%; position: absolute">
  <h1>B</h1>
  <p>As a high school junior, I am looking for a summer job working remotely. After summer, I would be able to continue on a part-time basis. While I plan to continue my computer education in college, I have solid knowledge of how to program right now (see my resume for details). As a young person, I could be a jolt of energy helping you get a few new, cool features out the door.</p>
