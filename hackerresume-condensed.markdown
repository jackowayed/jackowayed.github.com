Hire Me for the Summer {#intro}
======================

(Written in markdown extra in emacs, of course)

I'm young, and I have no work experience and not a whole lot of coding experience, but I know how to program, and I'm eager to learn to fill in the gaps.

What I Want to Do and Why  {#whatwhy}
-------------------------

Basically, I want to hack this summer. It could be full-time or a somewhat-large part-time. I need to make some money, and there's little that sounds worse to me than wasting my time in some mind-numbing job when I could be learning and enjoying my work coding. 

I'm looking for a fairly small company, possibly a startup. It doesn't have to be tiny, but I'm not looking for some giant corporation where I'll spend more time planning what I will code than actually implementing. 

Though I am quite open to startups, I do need to make a little money from it. I need at least $1k, preferably $2k or $3k, but as long as I make that much, the rest could be equity. 

Preferably, I would do something in Ruby, but I wouldn't mind learning to something something functional or Python.

Accomplishments & Experience {#experience}
----------------------------

* 2 Years of Java classes in school
  * 5 on the Advanced Placement Computer Science Exam (Maximum Score)
  * Wrote Conway's Game of Life w/ GUI in about an hour when I was bored in class. 
* Started using Ruby in summer '06, though didn't do much advanced until summer '08
* Ruby
  * Newspaper website in Rails (Didn't end up getting used (A preexisting service gets the articles entered into contests, something the Editor in Chief told me when I was 90% finished.) The code is [here](https://github.com/jackowayed/bluestreak/tree))
  * [Tweet Link Monster](http://tweetlinkmonster.com/)--48 users, and growing. 

############### talk about the state reps app when code is on github ################

This past summer, I got into it more. I learned Rails, and wrote a newspaper website in it. It's not deployed (Somehow, though I talked to the editor in chief about design decisions weekly, she decided not to tell me that we would use an already-existing website instead of what I wrote until I was 90% done.), but the code is [on github](https://github.com/jackowayed/bluestreak/tree). 

I then had to lookup 50 words online and copy the definitions as summer homework. This sounded like the most tedious thing ever, so I wrote [a script](https://github.com/jackowayed/lookup/tree), which I open-sourced, to do it. I didn't think it would take that much more time than actually looking it up, but it turns out parsing html sucks, especially when all dictionary websites display things in multiple structures for different words. 

I then decided I wanted to learn Merb. I also decided it would be cool to do something with the Twitter API so I could get experience using APIs. Michael had the idea of twitterlinks, which is now [Tweet Link Monster](http://tweetlinkmonster.com/). I learned so much doing it. I learned simple things, like how to use Merb, Haml (which I love), and DataMapper (which I also love), but I also learned a lot applicable to any programming project. After spending way too long trying to follow all of the different kinds of redirects that were in links so that I could fetch their titles, I found a library to do it for me. So I learned that if something seems too hard, and it's something other people have probably needed to do as well, there's probably a library out there that does it for you. I'm sure I learned much more that doesn't expressly come to mind. 

I then learned lots about deploying Merb apps and thus deploying in general. And I experienced a launch. I have 47 users now. (It would have done a lot better at launch and in general if it weren't that the Twitter API makes it basically impossible to make TLM not require people's passwords, which many people were wary of. I'm hoping that when OAuth finally comes out, I'll get a second surge of users.)

I've done a lot of small random things too. I wrote a most of the section about Datamapper in the [Merb book](https://github.com/jackowayed/lookup/tree). I've helped lots of people in #merb with fairly simple bugs that I could help with. 

################ Talk about twitter follower thing when it's deployed ############

I love Ruby and can use Java, but I'm willing to learn other languages (as long as you give me a few months' notice or are ok with me spending the first few weeks of summer doing more learning than working.) 

If I had to choose a language that I'd learn, it would probably be python because it sounds fairly Rubyish and powerful. Some functional like Lisp might be cool too, though I'm a little afraid of Lisp between the syntax and the functionality. I'm sure I could do it though. 

If need be, I could learn pretty much any language. The main limitation is that I really want to be able to develop on Linux. Windows is not my friend. My laptop does theoretically dual-boot with Vista though, so I might even consider going to the dark side and doing some MS language.
