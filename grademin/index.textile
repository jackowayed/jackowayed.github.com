h1. Calculate Minimum Grade You Need in the 4th Quarter to Get an A for the Year

h3. Note: this is made for The Charter School of Wilmington's grading system

The way the system works is that each quarter is worth 2x that of the midterm. So the midterm is worth 1/9 of your total grade and each quarter is worth 2/9. If your school matches this, and your school's minimum A is 93, it should still work. 

h2. Your Grades

Enter the percentages. For example, you might enter, "93". ".93" will not work. 

1st Quarter <input type="text" id="q1" size="4"/>
2nd Quarter <input type="text" id="q2" size="4"/>
Midterm <input type="text" id="mid" size="4"/>
3rd Quarter <input type="text" id="q3" size="4"/>

p(#answer). You need at least a 
<span id="ans">__</span>
in the 4th quarter to get an A for the year
