Hire Me for the Summer         {#intro}
======================

(Written in markdown extra in Emacs)

Basically, I want to hack this summer. It could be full-time or a somewhat-large part-time. I need to make some money, and there's little that sounds worse to me than wasting my time in some mind-numbing job when I could be learning and enjoying my work coding.

* I will embezzle as much as possible!

What I Want to Do and Why       {#whatwhy}
-------------------------

I'm looking for a fairly small company, possibly a startup. It doesn't have to be tiny, but I'm not looking for some giant corporation where I'll spend more time planning what I will code than actually implementing. 

The code I'm writing could be anything. Coolness of the project is a major plus, but I'd work on a lame project over doing a job most monkeys can do. 

Though I am quite open to startups and not working full-time, I do need to make at least $2k for the summer so that I'll be good on car insurance and gas until next summer. 

I'm available from the very beginning of June until Labor Day. 

I could work during the school year, both before summer and after, somewhere in the area of 5 hours a week if you want.  

I need to be able to take the week of July 19th off, and it would be nice if I could take random days off every once in awhile. 

I'd also love it if my hours weren't set, but I could handle normal hours too. 

Preferably, I would do something in Ruby, but I wouldn't mind learning to something something functional or Python. I could do pretty much any language though. 

### Interview Possibilities

I'll probably be in Atlanta for a few days sometime between April 10 and 19, when I could do interviews. 

If that doesn't work, you could interview me in/near Delaware, or we could do it via phone, email, IM, skype, magic CNN hologram, or carrier pigeon.

Accomplishments & Experience {#experience}
----------------------------

### Java {#java}

* 2 Years of Java classes in school

  * 5 (Max Score) on the Advanced Placement Computer Science AB (the harder one) Exam

    * [List of Topics Covered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Computer_Science#Topic_Outline)
  * Wrote Conway's Game of Life w/ GUI in about an hour when I was bored in class

### Ruby {#ruby}

* Started using Ruby in summer '06, though didn't do much advanced until summer '08
* Newspaper website in Rails 

	* Didn't end up getting used (A preexisting service gets the articles entered into contests, something the Editor in Chief told me when I was 90% finished.)
	
		* The code is [here](https://github.com/jackowayed/bluestreak/tree)
		
* [Tweet Link Monster](http://tweetlinkmonster.com/) in Merb--50 users, and growing.

	* Would have more, but Twitter makes it impossible not to take their passwords (unless I want to make an API call for every user that any user follows). People don't like giving away their passes to small sites.
	
* Sinatra Twitter Follower App
  * A 1-afternoon Sinatra-learning project. 
  * Give it 2 Twitter usernames, and it gives a list of people who follow both. 
  * Not deployed as of now. Should be soon. 
* Wrote a most of the section about Datamapper in the [Merb book](http://book.merbist.com/) 

### C {#c}

I know basic C, thanks my school forcing me to do science fair last year: 

#### Pi

I wrote 6 different Pi calculation formulas in C (w/ the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library so that I could hold a lot of digits) and saw how efficient they were. 

[code](http://github.com/jackowayed/pi-calc/tree)

### Want More Hacking? {#morehack}

I have a few more projects on [github](http://github.com/jackowayed). There's nothing big, but there are a few small hacks and a couple things I forked and made small contributions to.
