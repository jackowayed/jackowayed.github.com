# Hire Me For the Summer!

Basically, I want to hack this summer. It could be full-time or a somewhat-large part-time. I need to make some money, and there's little that sounds worse to me than wasting my time in some mind-numbing job when I could be learning and enjoying my work coding.

## Reference

Troy Davis is one of the founders of Seven Scale.

Michael Ivey is a friend, mentor, and kind of employer to me. (I'm "employed" part-time, but he has no paid work for me to do.) He's lead a play I've been in. He's helped me debug. I've helped him find bugs in his startups. (I even reverse-engineered a hash function he wrote and realized that he was just multiplying by a large number.) He can tell you a lot about me. Email him at ivey "at" gweezlebur "dot" com
