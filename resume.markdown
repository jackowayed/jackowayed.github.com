# Hire Me For the Summer!

Basically, I want to hack this summer. It could be full-time or a somewhat-large part-time. I need to make some money, and there's little that sounds worse to me than wasting my time in some mind-numbing job when I could be learning and enjoying my work coding.

## Objective

A summer programming position, preferably in Ruby, (I know other languages (see below), and I could learn a new one, preferably a functional language or Python, before the summer.) working remotely. 

## Education

Class rank #1 in the junior class at the 41st best public high school in the nation (US News & World Report).

## Experience

### Developed Greasemonkey Script for Github (February 2009)
