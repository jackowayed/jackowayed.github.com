# Hire Me For the Summer!

Basically, I want to hack this summer. It could be full-time or a somewhat-large part-time. I need to make some money, and there's little that sounds worse to me than wasting my time in some mind-numbing job when I could be learning and enjoying my work coding.

## Objective

A summer programming position, preferably in Ruby, (I know other languages (see below), and I could learn a new one, preferably a functional language or Python, before the summer.) working remotely.

## Education

### Charter School of Wilmington (Fall 2006-present)

Class rank #1 in the junior class at the 41st best public high school in the nation (US News & World Report).

## Experience

### Developed Sentdiff (February 2009)

Diff for writing. Splits the text by sentence first, then diffs that.

### Developed Greasemonkey Script for Github (February 2009)

Developed script that replaces default long URLs that point to a specific version of code with short URLs that point to the newest version.

## Reference

Michael Ivey is a friend, mentor, and kind of employer to me. (I'm "employed" part-time, but he has no paid work for me to do.) He's lead a play I've been in. He's helped me debug. I've helped him find bugs in his startups. (I even reverse-engineered a hash function he wrote and realized that he was just multiplying by a large number.) He can tell you a lot about me. Email him at ivey "at" gweezlebur "dot" com
